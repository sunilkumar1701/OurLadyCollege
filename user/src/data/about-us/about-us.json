    "desc1": "Our Lady College of Nursing is under the direction and management of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, generally known as the ICM Sisters. Mother Marie Louise De Meester is the foundress of the congregation. The congregation has its specific charism of Double Passion: namely, passion for God and compassionate love for the poor. Emerging from this double passion, the ICM Sisters are engaged in multiple services such as educational, medical, rural, social, technical, handicapped, and pastoral. All these services are oriented towards the upliftment and empowerment of those who are pushed to the periphery of society. The sole objective of the various ministries of the ICM Sisters is to create a society that is just and humane, wherein freedom, fellowship, and justice are experienced by every human being.",
